<!--
<p>Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is a branch of fluid mechanics. It uses numerical methods to solve the governing equations involving the fluid motion. This field is highly complex and involves the intersection of physics, high-performance computing, statistics, differential equations, data visualization and more. </p>

<p>If reader has ever spent a few hours on solving a basic heat transfer equation (one of the simplest Partial Differential Equations) by finite difference, he will understand the basic ideas behind CFD technique and he will understand that in order to solve a PDE correctly, he has to discretize the equation correctly, solve it correctly, set the boundary conditions and initial conditions correctly. In CFD, solving a Navier-Stokes Equation in turbulent state is much more complex than solving a heat equation, lots of assumptions and modeling need to be made, but it generally follows the same principles.</p>

<p>This CWE client is a platform aimed a provide online CFD tools to civil engineering users. Since our audience of users is from civil wind engineering, we don't want to burden first-time users with too many CFD details. So, the CWE platform is designed around the idea of a Virtual Wind Tunnel. Many of the key CFD parameters, such as the boundary condition settings and initial condition settings, have reasonable defaults. Also, we provide acceptable mesh generation and our platform is linked with TACC computing resources for parallel execution of simulations. </p>

<p>Experts in CFD, of course, will probably want to explore more deeply. For that reason, simulations can be downloaded, in part or in full, for further analysis and visualization.
