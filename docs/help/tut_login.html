<h1>Step 0: Starting the application and logging in to DesignSafe</h1>

<p>
The CWE tool allows you to create, execute, and view results of CFD simulations run remotely
 on one or more of DesignSave-ci's servers.  In order to utilize any of these features, you
 have to have an active account on DesignSave-CI.
 You can, <a href="https://www.designsafe-ci.org/rw/user-guides/getting-started/">create an account on DesignSave-ci</a>.

<ul>
<li>Start the tool and login to the CWE program using your DesignSafe-CI username and password.
Also, for this beta version, your username must be registered with the SimCenter development team.
(<a href="/help/about_simcenter.html">About NHERI SimCenter</a>, <a href="/help/about_developers.html">About the developers</a>)
</li>
<li>By clicking the login button, the CWE tool will attempt to connect you to DesignSafe-CI.
This may take from a few seconds to a minute.  You need to maintain a network connection while running
the CWE tool or you will loose your connection to the remote server and the tool will fail.
</li>
</ul>

<p>
Unless you are reading this page on a friend's computer, you successfully connected to DesignSafe-CI.
Congratulations!
