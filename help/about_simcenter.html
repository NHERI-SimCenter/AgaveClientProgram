<h1>About NHERI SimCenter and DesignSafe</h1>

<p>
The goal of the <strong>SimCenter</strong> is to provide the natural hazards engineering research and education
community with access to next-generation computational modeling and simulation software tools,
user support, and educational materials needed to advance the nation's capability to simulate
the impact of natural hazards on structures, lifelines, and communities. In addition, the new
center will enable leaders to make more informed decisions about the need for and effectiveness
of potential mitigation strategies.
</p>
<p>
The <strong>SimCenter</strong> will provide modeling and simulation tools using a new open-source framework that:
</p>
<ol>
<li>
addresses various natural hazards, such as windstorms, storm surge, tsunamis, and earthquakes;
</li>
<li>
tackles complex, scientific questions of concern to disciplines involved in natural hazards research,
including earth sciences, geotechnical and structural engineering, architecture, urban planning,
risk management, social sciences, public policy, and finance;
</li>
<li>
utilizes machine learning to facilitate and improve modeling and simulation using data obtained
from experimental tests, field investigations, and previous simulations;
</li>
<li>
quantifies uncertainties associated with the simulation results obtained;
</li>
<li>
utilizes the high-performance parallel computing, dXata assimilation, and related capabilities
to easily combine software applications into workflows of unprecedented sophistication and complexity;
</li>
<li>
extends and refines software tools for carrying out performance-based engineering evaluations and
supporting decisions that enhance the resilience of communities susceptible to multiple natural hazards; and
</li>
<li>
utilizes existing applications that already provide many of the pieces of desired computational workflows.
</li>
</ol>
