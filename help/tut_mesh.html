<h1>Step 2: Create a Mesh</h1>

<p>Once you have created a case, you can begin to do work.
First, select the folder containing the case in the 'Simulation Cases' tab.</p>

<p>Notice that the buttons on the bottom, in particular 'View Parameters/Details' is now available.
Click this button to go to the parameters screen.</p>

   </center>

<p>On the left side of the screen are tabs for 'mesh' and 'sim'.
For the 2D type of case, first a simulation mesh must be created.
Then the simulation can actually be run. There are parameters for each process.</p>

<p style="color: red;">For your first case, we suggest using a simple geometry that has been provided,
by selecting it next to 'Select Geometry File'. Later, you can upload your own geometries for simulation.</p>

<p>Other parameters under mesh define the size of the simulation domain, the boundary conditons, and more.</p>

<p>At any time, you can click 'save all parameters' to save your changes.
Click 'run' to begin generating your mesh. Under the 'remote jobs' tab,
you will be able to view the list of agave jobs in progress and monitor the
eventual completion of your mesh.</p>
