<h1>Step 4: Run Simulation</h1>

<p>Once you have created a case, you can begin to do work. First, select the folder containing the case in the 'Simulation Cases' tab.</p>

<p>Notice that the buttons on the bottom, in particular 'View Parameters/Details' is now available. Click this button to go to the parameters screen.</p>

<p>On the left side of the screen are tabs for 'mesh' and 'sim'. For the 2D type of case, first a simulation mesh must be created. Then the simulation can actually be run. There are parameters for each process.</p>

<p>Under the simulation step, there are parameters for simulation duration, timestep, turbulence modeling and more.</p>

<p>At any time, you can click 'save all parameters' to save your changes. Click 'run' to begin running the simulation. Under the 'remote jobs' tab, you will be able to view the list of agave jobs in progress and monitor the eventual completion of your simulation.</p>
