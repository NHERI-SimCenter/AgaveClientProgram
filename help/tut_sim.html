<h1>Step 3: Run Simulation</h1>

<p>
Once you successfully completed 
<a href="/help/tut_case.html">Step 1: Create a Case</a> and
<a href="/help/tut_mesh.html">Step 2: Create a Mesh</a>,
you are ready to run your simulation on DesignSafe.
</p>

<ol>
<li>
    In the 
    <img src="file::/help/Images/SimulationCases.png" alt="Simulation Cases" height="20">
    tab, select the folder containing the case 
</li>
<li>
    Notice that the buttons on the bottom, in particular
    <img src="file::/help/Images/ViewParameters.png" alt="View Parameters" height="20">
    is now available.
    Click this button to go to the parameters screen.
   <center>
      <img src="file::/help/Images/ParameterTabScreen.png" alt="View Parameters Screen" width="800">
   </center>
</li>
<li>
    On the left side of the screen are tabs for 'mesh parameters' and 'simulation parameters' [1].
    For the 2D type of case,
    a valid mesh must be created befor a simulation can be run (<a href="/help/tut_mesh.html">Step 2: Create a Mesh</a>).
</li>
<li>
    <p>
    Each template case comes with a reasonable set of analysis parameters.
    However, it is highly recommended to review all parameters and adjust them as appropriate.
    </p>
    <p>
    Parameters are conveniently grouped by analysis stages: 'mesh parameters' and 'simulation parameters' [1].
    (Further stages may be added with future releases of the CWE Workflow Tool.)
    Within each stage, parameters are further groupled by topics [2].
    </p>
    <p>
    Parameters such as CAD file name, number or size of elements, etc.,  are found under 'mesh parameters' [1].
    </p>
    <p>
    Parameters such as simulation duration, timestep, turbulence modeling and more are found under 'simulation parameters' [1].
    </p>
</li>
<li>
You may click
<img src="file::/help/Images/SaveAllParameters.png" alt="save all parameters" height="20"> [3]
at any time to save your changes to the remote filesystem.

Once done with your adjustments, click the
<img src="file::/help/Images/RunButton.png" alt="Run Button" height="20"> [4]
tab to begin running the simulation.
</li>
<li>
You can check and monitor your remote analysis status under the
<img src="file::/help/Images/RemoteJobs.png" alt="Remote Jobs" height="20">
tab.
