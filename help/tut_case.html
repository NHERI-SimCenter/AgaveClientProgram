<h1>Step 2: Create a Case</h1>

<p> Once you have uploaded a geometry file, you can create wind simulation cases. </p>
<p> First, login to the CWE program. Then: </p>

<ul>
<li>Click on the 'Simulation Cases' tab</li>
<li>Click on the 'Create New Case' Button</li>
<li>Select a folder to contain the new case</li>
<li>Type a name for the new case.<li>
<li>Select a template for the type of case. We recommend 2D simulation for your first case.</li>
</ul>

<p>After a short wait, the new case will be available for you to run. You can select it in the 'Simulation Cases' tab.</p>
