<h2>Quick Start</h2>
</center>

<p>
With the CWE Workflow tool, a TACC account, an internet connection, and a geometry file, you can easily generate a mesh and run a wind flow simulation. 
</p>  ligh
<p>
Each case is stored in a remote folder within your account on designsafe-ci. You choose where the case folder is created, and where geometry files are stored. 
</p>

<center>
<h2>Generate a Mesh</h2>
</center>
<p>
Select your case and click 'Parameters' > 'Mesh Parameters'. Select one of the default geometries or a previously uploaded geometry file for this case. You can change the mesh density, subdomains, and boundaries. Save your parameters using the 'save all parameters' button. Save all parameters, then press 'run' to kick off the mesh generation process on the remote server. 
</p>

<h2>Running a Simulation</h2>
</center>
<p>
Once you've generated a mesh, view your case's parameters again, but this time click 'Simulation Parameters'. Adjust simulation duration, time step, inflow velocity, kinematic viscosity, and other parameters. Again, press 'save all parameters' before clicking 'run' to kick off the simulation. 
</p>

<h2>Jobs</h2>
</center>
<p>
Once a mesh generation or simulation job has been kicked off, you'll see it running and can get status updates under the 'Jobs' tab. 
</p>

<center>
<h2>Results</h2>
</center>
<p>
Once a job has finished, select a case to view the mesh or simulation results. All case files can be easily downloaded from the case itself, or through the file manager used for uploading geometry files.
