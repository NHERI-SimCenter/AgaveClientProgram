<h1>Step 1: Create and Upload a Geometry</h1>

<p> The CWE workspace allows users to upload simulation geometries to run either 2D or 3D wind simulations against them. </p>

<p> For this version of the CWE, users can upload 'Alias Mesh' (.obj) files, easily creatable by FreeCAD and potentially other programs. </p>

<p> FreeCAD, (not affiliated with SimCenter) is freely available at: <a href='https://www.freecadweb.org'>https://www.freecadweb.org</a>

<p> We recommend using the 'Part Design' toolkit. After creating a geometry file to test, export it as a .obj file:</p>
<ul>
<li>Select the object to export.</li>
<li>Go to: File->Export</li>
<li>At the bottom, choose the file type: Alias Mesh(.obj)</li>
<li>Select a local location for this file and click 'save'.</li>
<li>Now, open the CWE program and login</li>
<li>Click on the 'Remote Files' tab</li>
<li>On the left side, find your geometry file</li>
<li>On the right side, choose a remote folder to upload to </li>
<li>Click 'upload' to upload the geometry file. Please Wait.</li>
</ul>

<p> Once your geometry file appears among the remote files, it is uploaded and can be used to create simulations. </p>

<p style="color: red;">Please note: this software is under continual development. The experience of our testing users may prompt us to include other file upload types. We welcome constructive feedback on this matter.</p>
